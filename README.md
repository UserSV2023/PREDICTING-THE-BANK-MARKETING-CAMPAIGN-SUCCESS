## PREDICTING-THE-BANK-MARKETING-CAMPAIGN-SUCCESS

**Abstract:**

The primary business problem addressed in this project is to optimize the direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. These campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required, to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed to or not.

This problem falls under the domain of supervised learning. The dataset provides labeled instances, indicating whether a client subscribed to the bank term deposit “Yes” or “No”. By utilizing this labeled data, supervised learning algorithms can be trained to predict future outcomes based on similar customer characteristics and interaction patterns. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can classify potential clients into subscription categories, enabling the bank to focus its resources on individuals more likely to subscribe to the term deposit.
Direct marketing campaigns are resource-intensive and require strategic planning to ensure a high return on investment. Understanding the factors influencing customers' subscription decisions is crucial for optimizing these campaigns. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the bank can analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends that indicate potential subscribers. This predictive analysis can significantly enhance the efficiency of the marketing efforts.

**Data Source and Description:**

The dataset has 21 columns and 42K rows/observations.

**Methodology:**

Exploratory Data Analysis:
We are planning to conduct a series of EDA steps for understanding the dataset. Some of them are:
-	Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for the numerical variables.
-	Data Visualization: Create various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and pie charts to explore the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
-	Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients between numerical features. Identify highly correlated features, as well as correlations with the target variable.
We are considering applying ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, KNN and Ensemble Methods. 
By considering a variety of EDA methods and machine learning models, we will thoroughly explore the dataset, identify meaningful patterns, and select the most appropriate model that aligns with the business problem.
